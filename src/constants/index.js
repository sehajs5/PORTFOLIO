    description: "Water is a scarce resource. Environmentalists have been constantly making the people aware about how the depleting water levels could lead to problems which could put the lives of future generations in peril. Therefore, we propose an alternate system for cleaning and disinfecting utensils where there would be minimal to no use of water involved. Apart from the reduced water usage, it will also have features like minimal manual labor and water recycling properties. Adding on, this method also evaporates the need to use a detergent or soap which makes the used water really difficult to be reused. We are proposing the use of technical giant ESP32 thing plus in accordance with its camera module and Wifi module to bring the theory into practicality. The ESP32 thing plus will be used to control the additional sensors and also the working of the entire mechanical system that isbeing proposed. There will be a suction pump that will suckall the leftovers and debris that have been removed from the dirty dishes. The crucial technical involvement will be the strong heating environment that will be provided in a closed chamber to all the utensils so that the food stuck to the surface can melt down and then can be removed. There will be microwaves and ultraviolet rays used using laser mechanisms to provide a clean environment all around. The utensils will have to be placed in a certain arrangement to provide maximum surface area that is exposed to the decontamination process. There will be a blink application used to link all the working of the dish disinfector to the mobile applications of the user so that all the steps can be closely monitored and the data analytics can be stored for future references. Consequently, TINY ML will be incorporated along with all these functionalities to identify if there is any debris yet left on the subjects even after the meticulous cleaning process. This is a 360-degree cleaning and disinfecting process which eliminates the need of water usage and recycling the little water that is being used.",

    description: "Artificial Intelligence has been working to meet the needs of humans for a very long time. There have been many progressive evolutions along the way. Neural Networks have emerged to be the best in the field of recognition and data analysis. There have been myriad developments and preparation of models over decades. There is CNN, RNN, FNN, DNN, TCN and many more. In this paper, we aim to compare the working of TCN which stands for Temporal Convolutional Network with the workings of above-mentioned models to figure out the best use of technology for catering the human needs. This paper is a deep analysis of the erstwhile models that are being used and how the temporal convolutional network finds its applications in the present scenario, what are the emerging fields that it can be implemented in and what were the positives of TCN over other neural network models. Through a careful study we have come to a conclusion that TCN could be the basic starting point of all the neural networks as it has proven to have less training time, less memory utilization and gives better results compared to other models. The functioning of TCN models is designed in such a way that no information can be drained from future to the past. Furthermore, the input image can be analyzed irrespective of the length as the same can be mapped to the output layer. TCN finds its application in various multilateral domains that includes healthcare, sequential forecasting, preventing cyber attacks, speech enhancement and many more. It has the capability to outperform the other models most of the time by a major difference and sometimes by a significant margin. Therefore, the applications of TCN can vary in accordance to the needs of the user.",

There are not one but many sectors that are being manipulated by this ever- growing technology. It is safe to say that each day machines are getting better at understanding humans which is due to the evolution and innovation in this field. In this paper, we have uncovered various sectors in which artificial intelligence along with its various branches like Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning(ML) and Computer Vision have helped the world curate a better place by personalizing every daily use item. This has enhanced the way we live. However, there is a lot of data that is being used in order to bring these technologies to life. We have highlighted the constraints as well as the pleasures that this technology can bring us.",

description: "Since the declaration of the concept of technology, it has been mankinds' ultimate motive to make human work easier. There has to be minimum physical effort that humans have to put in in order to accomplish both daily and complex tasks. Automation is one of the key concepts that has replaced the existing workforce with machinery. Smart home automation systems aim to bring the technology of automation to homes. It has replaced the concept of switches, circuit boards and brought the technology in the hands of the user in literal sense. The system can obtain commands and instructions from the user directly through voice automation systems and perform tasks like dimming the lights and turning on the fan with minimal to no physical effort at all. Smart home automation systems aim to bring the idea of automation to a comfortable workspace where people can control their surrounding devices from their mobile phones. In this paper, we have reviewed various different technologies which are used in order to accomplish a safe and fast network in which the devices can communicate with each other. There are various different ways of doing the same thing and this paper reviews multiple ways in which the smart home automation system can work to provide the best results with minimum constraints.",    technologies: ["Review", "Machine Learning"],
